# argsparser

*argsparser* is an universal command line parsing library for C++11. It features complex options parsing like: vectors, maps, and YAML integration for saving command line options in structured form.

The code uses *yaml-cpp* library for YAML files handling, version 0.6.x is required.

The code is based on arguments parsing facility from *Intel(R) MPI Benchmarks*, but it forked from that code
in 2018 and was extended significantly since then. The license is kept the same as for the whole Intel(R) MPI Benchmarks code: Common Public License Version 1.0. See "license.txt" file for details.
